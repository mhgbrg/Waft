# Retrospective
## Things to improve

### Testing
 - We're not completely sure how to do the testing when it comes to GUI components. We will look closer on that next sprint. 
 - The [Android giude](https://developer.android.com/tools/testing/index.html) might prove itself useful.

### GUI
 - Designing and constructing the GUI took more time than anticipated. We'll have to take that into account next sprint planning. 
 - We will most likely need to have a common graphical profile in mind.
 
### Work flow
 - We should inform each other when we will work, so we can work together more easily
 - We need to be more aware of scope creep, and only work on things that are required.
 - Don't add items to the definition of done during the sprint. It changes our velocity
 - We need to stop "manipulating" the product owners
 - Talk more to the product owners. "Invitation to conversation"
 - Keep the technical lingo out when talking to the product owners. Imagine they don't know anything about coding
 - Use pull requests
 - Have a more rigorous sprint planning session
 - Remember to take breaks!
 
### Roles
 - Make product owner and scrum master hats

## Good things
 - Good documentation
 - Good use of Slack, Trello etc.
 - ElectriCity, Keolis and VÃ¤sttrafik really like our idea
 - It's nice to work together in the same room
 - Good overall communication, especially about patterns and code structure
