# Notes for sprint planning w.5

Issue: People working over the weekend even though we decided the differ.

This gave some team members stress, since it felt like they were doing nothing. 

How did we solve this? What do we actually want?

Suggestions:

	1. Work monday-friday
	2. Work monday-monday

Argument for mon-fri:

	* Less stress
	* What we actually decided from the begining
	* Probably a better way to not get burnout

Arguments against:

	* People started working over the weekend anyways. Potensial solution would be to not tell the other team members that you're working (probably not the best)
	* Our time is limited and we want to get more stuff done
	* It's awesome to code over weekends

Arguments mon-mon:

	* Some of us want to work over weekends
	* It's awesome to code over weekends
	* You could possibly get a brilliant idea over the weekend

Arguments against:
	
	* Probably feels good for a week but will probably end up with us getting burnout.


Ended up with a compromise:

The sprint will still be between mon-fri. But with the little extension that after the sprint review and retrospective, there's a chance to take up any loose thread left from last sprint. IMPORTAN! Not mandatory, it's not something that's necessary.
