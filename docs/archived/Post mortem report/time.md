# Oscar Evertsson, reflections regarding time

The main issue was understanding the other party in this discussion. For me it wasn't even an option to change my mind regarding coming late or not. For me it's simple, either you get there on time or you don't. It's not that hard. I can imagine the other side of this argument probably thought exactly the same but the otherway around. For me that was hard.

After talking to burden he shared some light on how he handles those situation. He simply accepted the fact that people will be late. Instead of becoming irritated and taking it personally he choose to accept it and spend his energy somewhere else. In his case, he spent time looking through email, made some calls etc.


I think I will have a hard time accepting the behavior of coming late. But that doesn't mean I can't accept the fact that people will still continue to arrive late. I make my own decisions and just assume that people will be late. Instead I could see it as a possibility to get some other stuff done. If my mindset is that people will be late and I can't really do anything about it, that will make it more easy to hadnle.
