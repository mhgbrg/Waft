# StämplaAppen – social ticket inspection outlook

## Where are the ticket inspectors?

A map, a lot like Waze, with information about ticket inspectors. People report where they've seen them, either on the bus or at stops. The more people report on an area or line, the "hotter" it gets.

### Why?

We want people to pay for their ride. That's why we even have inspections. We want people to know that their tickets might get inspected. But not seeing any ticket inspectors make people feel that they don't exist. We can make people aware that paying for your ticket might be a good idea.

### Won't it just hurt business?

These tools are already out there. There are lots of underground systems like this in use, on Facebook, Twitter, and SMS services. Hoping it will go away is not as powerful as taking control over it: offering the best service, and using it for your purposes. Make people know that paying pays, and that it goes to good stuff, like better public transit.

And even if people use the app, they can't be sure whether there will be an inspection or not, only when the risk is heightened. A negative answer in the app does not correspond to there being no inspections. The app only makes buying a ticket **more** attractive, not less.

If you are paying now, would you stop if you had the app? Most likely not.

### How can it be used to the transit companies' advantage?

It makes pure economic sense. When people have information that there are inspections, they will make a decision based on that. Not enough people paying means there aren't enough checks. The app is a research opportunity for finding the right amount.

The transit companies also have to put in hard work to polish their public image. It's an ungrateful job. Being transparent, kind, and publishing information that makes people empathise with your work through the app is better than giving the freeriders a monopoly on these kinds of services.

### What else could the app do?

It could encourage paying and checking in on the bus. How? By making each krona count. Whenever you buy a pass or spend money on a ticket, you can register it in the app, which could give you

* Bonus points to buy more tickets for.
* Sweepstakes to win prices.

Or anything else that is an encouragement, really. Every time you check in on the bus and register your card afterwards, you could also get these encouragements.

#### Other features

* A map with buses: where are they, are they full, are they on time, and so on.
* Showing rental bikes available nearby
* Vibrating and sending messages when you are entering ticket inspection hot zones – time to pay!
* Reporting from Västtrafik – where are we focusing inspection our efforts right now?

## How does it work and look?

### Reporting

Simply press a button: inspection on the bus you are on, or inspection on a tram stop. 

1. If you report on a stop, your GPS is used to determine the area of the inspection.
1. If you report on a bus or tram, either
    1. If it's an electric bus, we determine which one by using the wifi and GPS signals. (Showing of the new bus technology, wooo!)
    2. If it's a regular one, tell us which line and which direction.

### Looking for checks

Fire up the map. You can now see a heat map with drop pins where there have been reports the last day, with the more recent ones being more pronounced. Ticket checks on bus lines are marked with colored lines and arrows, indicating direction and line. More pronounced = more recent.
