## Who is the target customer?

The app is mainly a tool for companies to get refined, detailed status reports in real time from real customers. The target customer i Västtrafik, since they are the ones immediately responsible for collecting customer claims. In the end, subcontractors like Keolis and Volvo will get and be able to use the same data.

The companies that together are responsible for the public transport of Gothenburg. The main target customer is Västtrafik, as it has the overall responsibility and is most visible to everyday commuters. Companies like Keolis and Volvo could also quite possibly benefit from our product.

## Which customer needs will the product address?

The companies lack relevant information about what the customers feel about their travels. Even though many people write on e.g. Västtrafik’s Facebook wall, the things they write often lack crucial information and are not always constructive. According to Andréas Almquist, a representative from Västtrafik, information about the commuters themselves are a growing concern, especially since they plan to expand heavily during the coming years. Our application aims to solve this issue by providing the companies with relevant, up-to-date information directly from the travelers.

## Which product attributes are critical to satisfy the needs selected, and therefore for the success of the product

The product relies on providing users incitament to report issues, as well as positive feedback, so we will focus on people’s ability to help each other. If all users can see what kind of information others provide, it provides more value to them. Users also gain more incitament to report issues themselves and leave to leave feedback. One attribute is therefore the fact that users will see all the reports about the public transit vehicles, either on a map or using a bus stop specific list. 

Leaving feedback should be easy and should not take more than one or two clicks, with the application itself detecting which bus or bus stop the user is currently on. 

## How does the product compare against existing products, both from competitors and the same company? What are the product's unique selling points?

Our application will provide more up-to-date and extensive information than the available alternatives, based on the fact that it’s crowd sourced. Since the users aim to help each other the feedback will be more constructive than complaints on Facebook. The relevant companies will also be able to see reports relevant to themselves, instead of many issues being reported to the wrong instance. 

In conclusion, our application will bring crowd-sourced issue reporting to the public transport sector of Gothenburg, creating value for both the companies and the commuter community.
