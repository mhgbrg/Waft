Special needs cases
---------

### Wheelchairs (holds for prams, people who need to sit, maybe more cases)

#### Traveler use case

Travellers in wheelchairs sometimes have to wait for several buses and trams, because there is only room for one, maybe two, wheelchairs on any single bus or tram. They can use the app to see if there is room for a wheelchair on the coming vehicles. They can filter flags to see only the relevant ones.

#### Traveler value 

By keeping an updated record of when all wheelchair spots are occupied, our app allows travelers in wheelchairs to make more informed decisions.

#### Stakeholder use case

Stakeholders can see long term statistics over how often the wheelchair spots are occupied.

#### Stakeholder value

With the statistics and live data, stakeholders can decide whether to put in more vehicles on a line, both immediately and in the long term.

### Using the screens on the stops

The data displayed in the app can be displayed to the screens on the stops as well. Instead of using an ordinary time table, people can see the actual traffic and the status of it.

### "Hur vill du har det?"

The public transport companies of the city created the poll "Hur vill du ha det" to gather data about he public's opinions about public transport. They estimate that *3,000,000* people visited the site (HOLY SHIT!) but only 1,100 people answered the poll. Imagine that. Why? Because it was a boring and pointless way to query people. And how are you as a travler supposed to remember the small nuiscances of everyday travels when asked about them later on?

Our app makes people report things *right when they are thinking of the*, giving higher quality data.
